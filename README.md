## Introduction
Efficient delivery time is crucial for customer satisfaction in the food delivery industry. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive case study on Doordash deliveries to understand the factors influencing delivery time and provide actionable insights to reduce it by 5%. The analysis covers various aspects of the delivery process, including order placement, restaurant preparation, and delivery logistics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains historical Doordash delivery data, including information such as order timestamps, restaurant details, driver information, and delivery time. The dataset provides valuable insights into the factors affecting delivery time and serves as the foundation for the exploratory data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis phase involves performing a thorough examination of the delivery data to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends. Key areas of analysis include:

- Order volume and frequency
- Delivery time distribution and outliers
- Impact of different factors (e.g., distance, time of day) on delivery time
- Relationship between delivery time and customer ratings
- Analysis of restaurant preparation and driver performance metrics

The findings from this analysis will serve as the basis for identifying areas of improvement and formulating data-driven strategies to reduce delivery time.

## Machine Learning (Work in Progress)
The project includes a machine learning component that aims to develop predictive models for estimating delivery time accurately. The ML section is currently in progress, and ongoing work involves training and evaluating various regression models to predict delivery time based on available features. The ML models will be integrated into the analysis to provide more accurate insights and recommendations.

## Product Management Suggestions
Based on the analysis and insights gained from the EDA, a set of product management suggestions will be provided to reduce the delivery time by 5%. These suggestions may include:

- Optimizing routing algorithms for drivers to minimize travel time
- Implementing dynamic time slot-based ordering to manage peak delivery times
- Streamlining the order preparation process at restaurants
- Enhancing driver allocation strategies to ensure efficient distribution of orders
- Improving communication and coordination between drivers, restaurants, and customers

These suggestions will be supported by data-driven evidence and are aimed at enhancing the overall delivery experience and reducing delivery time.

## Future Scope
The project has potential avenues for further improvement and expansion, including:

- Development of a Streamlit web application to provide interactive visualizations and insights from the analysis
- Incorporation of location data and algorithms to suggest optimal warehouse locations for Doordash to improve delivery efficiency
- Integration of real-time data streams to enable dynamic tracking and prediction of delivery times
- Collaboration with Doordash or similar companies to implement and validate the suggested improvements

Contributions from the open-source community are welcomed to enhance the project further.
